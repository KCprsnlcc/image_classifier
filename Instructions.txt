Implement the Image Classification code as either a Flask or a Django application.
You can have it in a hosting or just within your local computer.
The code should be able to do the following:
1. Accept sample images and classes
Ask for classes/names of persons
Ask for image samples per class
2. Have a button to start training
3. Show on the webpage the result of the classification.
Ask the user to pick one of the images
Show the classification
